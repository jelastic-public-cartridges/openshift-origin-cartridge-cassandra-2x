# Jelastic Cassandra 2 Cartridge
This cartridge provides [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) on Jelastic Platform.

**Apache Cassandra** database is a NoSQL platform with continuous availability, high scalability and performance, strong security, operational simplicity and lower overall cost of ownership. 

The provided linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra also includes a support for replicating across multiple data centers, providing lower latency and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages.

In addition, Cassandra 2 includes the following major enhancements:
* support for lightweight transactions;
* triggers for events, that execute a set of programmatic logic;
* CQL enlargement;
* better authentication;
* index improvements;
* higher performance.

### What Jelastic cartridge is?

Jelastic [Platform-as-Infrastructure](http://docs.jelastic.com/what-is-platform-as-infrastructure) supports **OpenShift’s cartridge model** to make it easier for independent software vendors (ISVs) offering core services in multiple platforms and for a wider array of cloud ecosystems and marketplaces. This open standard for technology packaging and deployment enables ISVs and end-users to integrate their own middleware, databases, and services into the platform and make them available to PaaS developers building applications.

A **cartridge** is an advanced packaging format. In our case, it is represented with existing OpenShift cartridge specifications, extended with Jelastic configurations, to provide more complex functionality and the ability to make adjustments in Jelastic. This additional tuning is required based on the difference between the architectures of the two platforms (Jelastic and OpenShift).

Such configuration is quite easy - you just need to fork a basic cartridge and add custom settings. Detailed instruction on how to create your own cartridge can be seen [here](http://ops-docs.jelastic.com/create-cartridge).


### How to add a cartridge to Jelastic Cloud?

Ready cartridge (your own or one of those we’ve already prepared for you) can be added to the Jelastic PaI via JCA. After that it should be tested and published in order to become available through the dashboard. Find out the details in [this](http://ops-docs.jelastic.com/private-add-cartridge) instruction.
